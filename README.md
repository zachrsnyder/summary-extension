# I Ain't Readin' Allat

Hello! This is my first attempt at developing something for the web. I am going to attempt to **Summarize** some of the things I learned in the process in hopes that someone might read this and find it interesting and to help wrap my brain around everything I learned.

### The Mission

#### The problem:
The problem is rooted in laziness. I do not like to read, especially about politics. 

#### The solution:
So to make that task, that I feel as though I should do, a little easier, I wanted to make a chrome extension that could summarize and shorten the passage I was reading. I had used ChatGpt to generate summaries for me in the past so I knew it was legit and could be used to create a good solution to my problem.

This was also a subproblem in my teams' tigerhacks project this year: [The Otherside](https://github.com/aaron-yang799/tiger-hacks), but we had no experience with web development prior to that so not much was accomplished. However, the idea and attempt got us 6th place!.
